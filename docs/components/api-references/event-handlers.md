# Event handling

Annotation events are handled by the annotation component.
The component emits different events based on user interactions with the annotations.

One or multiple event handlers can be registered to the component using the `on` method.

```typescript
const textAnnotation = createAnnotatedText(id)
  .on('all', ({ mouseEvent, event, data }) => {
    // To handle all events
    console.log(mouseEvent, event, data);
  })
  .on('click', () => {
    // handle click event
  });
```

By default the events will be logged to the console with debug statements.

## Examples

<script setup>
//
import { onMounted } from "vue";
import { createAnnotatedText, PlainTextAdapter, clearAnnotatedTextCache } from "@ghentcdh/annotated_text";
import { plainText } from "@demo";

const id = "annotation-log";

onMounted(()=> {
    clearAnnotatedTextCache()
    createAnnotatedText(id,
        {
            text: PlainTextAdapter(),
            annotation: {
                create: true,
                edit: true
            },
        })
    .setText(plainText.text)
    .setAnnotations(plainText.annotations)
    .on('all', ({ mouseEvent, event, data }) => {
        console.log(mouseEvent, event, data);
        const logger = document.getElementById("annotation-logger");
        if (logger) {
            logger.innerHTML = `<p><b>${event}</b>: ${data.annotation.id}</p>`;
        }
