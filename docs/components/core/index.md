# Core

The annotated text renderer allows you to display text with annotations in a structured way. It supports various
features such as rendering nested annotations, handling user actions, and more.

The component developed by GhentCDH can be used either as a Vue component or as a standalone JavaScript
implementation.

Depending on your applicationâ€™s requirements and how change detection is handled, you may prefer to use the JavaScript
version.

Add it to your project

```bash
npm i @ghentcdh/vue-component-annotated-text
```

```bash
pnpm i @ghentcdh/vue-component-annotated-text
```

For more information related to the vue component visit the [Vue documentation](../vue/index).
