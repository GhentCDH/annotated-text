# W3C - Web annotation Data Model

W3C annotation formats are used to create annotations that can be shared and reused across different platforms and
applications. They are based on the W3C Web Annotation Data Model and can be used to annotate text, images, and other
resources.

> More information can be found in the [W3C Web Annotation Data Model](https://www.w3.org/TR/annotation-model/)
> specification.

:::info
W3C text annotations are partially implemented, check the documentation for implementation details.
